            Agent-to-Agent Authentication and Authorization
      draft-agent2agent-kasselman_lombardo-agent2agent-auth-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a framework for secure agent-to-agent (A2A)
   interactions leveraging existing standards such as OAuth 2.0 and the
   Workload Identity Management and Secure Exchange (WIMSE)
   architecture.  Rather than defining new protocols, this document
   explores how existing and widely deployed stnadards can be applied or
   extended to establish agent-to-agent authentication and
   authorization.  By doing so, it aims to provide a framewrok within
   which to identify use of existing standards and identify gaps and
   guide future standardization efforts for secure agent-to-agent
   authentication and authorization.

1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Agents are workloads

   An Agent is a workload that iteratively interacts with a Large
   Language Model (LLM) and a set of tools that expose interfaces to
   underlying services and resources until a terminating condition,
   determined either by the LLM or by the agent’s internal logic, is
   reached.  It may receive input from a user, or act autonomusly.
   Figure 1 shows a conceptual model of the AI Agent as a workload.

   Figure 1 illustrates the high-level interaction model between the
   User, the AI Agent, the Large Language Model (LLM), the Tools invoked
   by the Agent, and the underlying Services and Resources accessed
   through those Tools.

                  +----------------+
                  | Large Language |
                  |   Model (LLM)  |
                  +----------------+
                        ^   |
                    (2) |   | (3)
                        |   v
   +--------+       +------------+       +--------+       +-----------+
   |  User  |--(1)->| AI Agent   |--(4)->| Tools  |--(5)->| Services  |
   |        |       | (workload) |       |        |       |   and     |
   |        |--(8)->|            |<-(7)--|        |<-(6)--| Resources |
   +--------+       +------------+       +--------+       +-----------+

                      Figure 1: AI Agent as a Workload

   1.  Optional: The User provides an initial request or instruction to
       the AI Agent.

   2.  The AI Agent forwards the available context to the LLM.  Context
       isimplementation and deployment specific and may include User
       input, system prompt, tool descriptions, tool outputs and other
       relevant information.

   3.  The LLM returns a response to the AI Agent identifying which
       tools it should invoke.

   4.  Based on the LLM’s output, the AI Agent invokes the relevant
       Tools.

   5.  The Tools interacts with the underlying Services and Resources
       required to fulfill the requested operation.

   6.  The underlying Services and Resources returns the information
       requested by the Tools.

   7.  The Tools returns the information collected from the Services and
       Resources to the AI Agent, which sends the information as
       additional context to the Large Langugage Model, repeating steps
       2-7 until the exit condition is reached and the task is
       completed.

   8.  Optional: Once the exit condition is reached in step 7, the AI
       Agent may return a response to the User.

   As shown in Figure 1, the AI Agent is a workload that needs and
   identifier and credentials with which to authenticate itself to the
   Large Langugage Model and Tools.  Once it has authenticated, the
   Large Langugage Model and Tools must determine if the AI Agent is
   authorized to access it.  If the AI Agent is acting on-behalf-of a
   User, the User needs to deelegate access to the AI Agent, and the
   context of the User needs to be preserved to inform authorization
   decisions.

   This document describes how AI Agents should leverage existing
   standards like SPIFFE, WIMSE, OAuth and SSF.

4.  Agent Identity Management System

   An Agent Identity Management System ensure that the right Agent has
   access to the right resources and tools at the right time for the
   right reason.  It consists out of the following components:

   *  *Agent Identifiers:* Unique identifier assigned to every Agent.

   *  *Agent Credentials:* Cryptographic binding between the Agent
      Identifier and attributes of the Agent.

   *  *Agent Attestation:* Mechanisms for determining and assigning the
      identifier and issue credentials based on measurements of the
      Agent's environment.

   *  *Agent Credential Provisioning:* The mechanism for provisioning
      credentials to the agent at runtime.

   *  *Agent Authentication:* Protocols and mechanisms used by the Agent
      to authenticate itself to Large Langugage Models or Tools
      (resource or server) in the system.

   *  *Agent Authorization:* Protocols and systems used to determine if
      an Agent is allowed to access a Large Langugage Model or Tool
      (resource or server).

   *  *Agent Monitoring and Remediation:* Protocols and mechanisms to
      dynamically modify the authorization decisions based on observed
      behaviour and system state.

   *  *Agent Auhtentication and Authorization Policy:* The configuration
      and rules for each of the Agent Identity Management System.

   *  *Agent Compliance:* Measurement of the state and fucntioning of
      the system against the stated policies.

5.  Agent Identifier

   Key point - agents must be uniquely identified.  Proposal is to use a
   WIMSE or WIMSE compatible identifier (basicaly a URI).  Refer to
   WIMSE identifier draft.

6.  Agent Credentials

   Key point - identifier must be bound to a credential.  Credentials
   have expiry dates and additional attributes relevant to the agent.
   multiple formats are possible.  JWTs, X.509 and WITs.  Reference
   SPIFFE, WIMSE.  Refer to API keys as an anit pattern. also say
   something about credential exchange.

7.  Agent Attestation

   Key point - agent attestation is the equivalent of identiy proofing.
   there are numerous mechanisms through which this may be achieved,
   which are deployment and risk specific.  Reference WIMSE and SPIFFE
   approaches here.

8.  Agent Credential Provisioning

   Key point - credentials are dynamically provisioned at runtime, they
   are short lived to remove need for expiry management.  Provisioning
   includes initial provisioning and rotation.  Refer to SPIFFE and
   WIMSE.  Maybe hint at using SCIM here?

9.  Agent Authentication

   Key point - agents may authenticate in a number of ways based on
   credentials, supported protocols and environment.  Distinguish
   between network and application layer.  Refernece WIMSE.

9.1.  Network layer authentication

   MTLS

9.2.  Application layer authentication

   WPT, HTTP Sig.

10.  Agent Authorization

   Key point - OAuth is broadly supported and provides a delegation
   model for users to clients (aka agents).  Agents can obtain acess
   tokens directly (client credentials flow, using above authentication
   methods) or it can be delegated to them by a user (OAuth flows).
   Make point that the access token includes the client_id, which is the
   same as the Agent ID (ore related to it) and can be used for
   authroization decisions, along with other claims in an Access Token
   (reference JWT Access token spec).  Make provision for opaque tokens
   as well.  Discuss Downscoping of agent authorization using
   transaction tokens.  Discuss cross-domain authorization (use cases)
   and how it may be achieved (identity chaining and cross-domain
   authorization).  Discuss human in the loop authroization.  Note
   concerns, refer to cross-device BCP as examples of consent phishing
   attacsk.  Talk about CIBA as a protocol.

   Picture -> Access Token -> Transaction Token -> Domain 1 -> Domain 2

10.1.  Same Domain Authorization

10.1.1.  Initial Authorization

   User Delegated Authroization Initial authorization - user or agent
   gets access token.

10.1.2.  Donwscoped, Time Bount, Context Enriched Agent Authorization

   Transaction Tokens

10.1.3.  Agent-to-Resource Authorization

   Present token, peform additional authorization (RBAC etc?)  Direct or
   via tools Resources, services.

   Agent -> Tool -> Service -> Resource

10.1.4.  Human-in-the loop

   Agent framework problem -> human in the loop - confirm something that
   it can already do - agent framework capability - confirmation.  Risk
   management flow.  Human in the loop - request esalated privelages.
   Step-up authorization - refernece the draft (maybe)

   MCP Elicitation to agent to perform some browser things - start authz
   code grant flow.  CIBA

10.2.  Cross Domain Agent-to-Agent Authorization

   Identiyt chaining, ID-Jag.

11.  Agent Monitoring and Remediation

   Key point - ongoing monitoring and remediation is needed.  Use
   protocols like SSE, CAEP to respond to changes in authorization.
   Note the need for ongoing logging and audit trails.  Talk about end-
   to-end audit and how this is enabled by having agent identifiers.

12.  Agent Auhtentication and Authorization Policy

   Key point - configuration and parameters for all the above
   constitutes policy.  Not stnadardises and not recommended for
   standrdisation?  Perhaps somethign about document format?

13.  Agent Compliance

   Key point - audit against Agent Identity Policy - not standrdised and
   not recommended to standardise.

14.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

15.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
