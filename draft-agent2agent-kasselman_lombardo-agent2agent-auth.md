--- abstract

This document proposes a framework for secure agent-to-agent (A2A) interactions leveraging existing standards such as OAuth 2.0 and the Workload Identity Management and Secure Exchange (WIMSE) architecture. Rather than defining new protocols, this document explores how existing and widely deployed stnadards can be applied or extended to establish agent-to-agent authentication and authorization. By doing so, it aims to provide a framewrok within which to identify use of existing standards and identify gaps and guide future standardization efforts for secure agent-to-agent authentication and authorization.

# Agents are workloads
An Agent is a workload that iteratively interacts with a Large Language Model (LLM) and a set of tools that expose interfaces to underlying services and resources until a terminating condition, determined either by the LLM or by the agent’s internal logic, is reached. It may receive input from a user, or act autonomusly. {{fig-agent-basic}} shows a conceptual model of the AI Agent as a workload.

{: #fig-agent-basic title="AI Agent as a Workload"}

Figure 1 illustrates the high-level interaction model between the User, the AI Agent, the Large Language Model (LLM), the Tools invoked by the Agent, and the underlying Services and Resources accessed through those Tools. 

1. Optional: The User provides an initial request or instruction to the AI Agent.
2. The AI Agent forwards the available context to the LLM. Context isimplementation and deployment specific and may include User input, system prompt, tool descriptions, tool outputs and other relevant information.
3. The LLM returns a response to the AI Agent identifying which tools it should invoke.
4. Based on the LLM’s output, the AI Agent invokes the relevant Tools. 
5. The Tools interacts with the underlying Services and Resources required to fulfill the requested operation.
6. The underlying Services and Resources returns the information requested by the Tools.
7. The Tools returns the information collected from the Services and Resources to the AI Agent, which sends the information as additional context to the Large Langugage Model, repeating steps 2-7 until the exit condition is reached and the task is completed. 
8. Optional: Once the exoot condition is reached in step 7, the AI Agent may return a response to the User.

# Agent Identifier
Key point - agents must be uniquely identified. Proposal is to use a WIMSE or WIMSE compatible identifier (basicaly a URI). Refer to WIMSE identifier draft.

# Agent Credentials
Key point - identifier must be bound to a credential. Credentials have expiry dates and additional attributes relevant to the agent. multiple formats are possible. JWTs, X.509 and WITs. Reference SPIFFE, WIMSE. Refer to API keys as an anit pattern. also say something about credential exchange.

# Agent Attestation
Key point - agent attestation is the equivalent of identiy proofing. there are numerous mechanisms through which this may be achieved, which are deployment and risk specific. Reference WIMSE and SPIFFE approaches here.

# Agent Credential Provisioning
Key point - credentials are dynamically provisioned at runtime, they are short lived to remove need for expiry management. Provisioning includes initial provisioning and rotation. Refer to SPIFFE and WIMSE.

# Agent Authentication
Key point - agents may authenticate in a number of ways based on credentials, supported protocols and environment. Distinguish between network and application layer. Refernece WIMSE.

## Network layer authentication
MTLS

## Application layer authentication
WPT, HTTP Sig.

# Agent Authorization
Key point - OAuth is broadly supported and provides a delegation model for users to clients (aka agents). Agents can obtain acess tokens directly (client credentials flow, using above authentication methods) or it can be delegated to them by a user (OAuth flows). Make point that the access token includes the client_id, which is the same as the Agent ID (ore related to it) and can be used for authroization decisions, along with other claims in an Access Token (reference JWT Access token spec). Make provision for opaque tokens as well. Discuss Downscoping of agent authorization using transaction tokens. Discuss cross-domain authorization (use cases) and how it may be achieved (identity chaining and cross-domain authorization). Discuss human in the loop authroization. Note concerns, refer to cross-device BCP as examples of consent phishing attacsk. Talk about CIBA as a protocol.

Picture -> Access Token -> Transaction Token -> Domain 1 -> Domain 2

## Same Domain Authorization

### Initial Authorization
User Delegated Authroization Initial authorization - user or agent gets access token.

### Donwscoped, Time Bount, Context Enriched Agent Authorization
Transaction Tokens

### Agent-to-Resource Authorization
Present token, peform additional authorization (RBAC etc?)
Direct or via tools
Resources, services.

Agent -> Tool -> Service -> Resource

### Human-in-the loop
Agent framework problem -> human in the loop - confirm something that it can already do - agent framework capability - confirmation. Risk management flow.
Human in the loop - request esalated privelages. Step-up authorization - refernece the draft (maybe)

MCP Elicitation to agent to perform some browser things - start authz code grant flow.
CIBA

## Cross Domain Agent-to-Agent Authroization
Identiyt chaining, ID-Jag.

# Agent Monitoring and Remediation
Key point - ongoing monitoring and remediation is needed. Use protocols like SSE, CAEP to respond to changes in authorization. Note the need for ongoing logging and audit trails. Talk about end-to-end audit and how this is enabled by having agent identifiers.

# Agent Auhtnetication and Authorization Policy
Key point - configuration and parameters for all the above constitutes policy. Not stnadardises and not recommended for standrdisation? Perhaps somethign about document format?

# Agent Compliance
Key point - audit against Agent Identity Policy - not standrdised and not recommended to standardise.
